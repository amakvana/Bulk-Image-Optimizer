# Bulk Image Optimizer
Bulk Optimize Images via Windows Context menu

The compression is lossless and therefore every ounce of quality is retained :)

## Installation
* Download the [setup](https://github.com/amakvana/Cemu-Auto-Shader-Compiler/releases/download/v1.0/cemu-auto-shader-compiler.bat) script 
* Place the script in the same folder cemu.exe lives in 

## Usage
* Run cemu-auto-shader-compiler.bat Right-click on a folder containing images you'd like to compress
* Enter the path containing your Wii U games (.rpx files)
* The script should kick off loading each game through Cemu, auto compiling its shaders and building pipeline cache 
* Once the script is done - feedback will be provided
